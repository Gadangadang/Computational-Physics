# Project 4

Here are the instructions for operating the numerical machinery.

## preamble:
Due to the nature of the solution there are different mains for different tasks. This is because our solver class is very general, and therefore requires specialized input for different solutions. Therefore, all code is inside the 'CodeBase' folder and you will execute the different aspects by editing and running the makefile. Its intended to run only one main_X at a time. We have not tested with multiple mains, but it should work.

### Makefile setup
The contents of the makefile look like this:
```
compile:
  	
execute:
	
```
### Instructions for running code
a makefile comment is a '#' character. to run the makefile open a terminal and type 'make all' to execute.

To run task a):
  - uncomment the main_a line under the 'compile' section
  - uncomment the main_a.x line under the 'execute' section
  - uncomment the Plotte_code.py line under the 'execute' section
  - uncomment the Plotte_code_MB.py line under the 'execute' section

Expected result for a):
 


To run task c):
  

Expected result for c):
 


To run task d):
 

Expected result for d):



To run task e):
 
Expected result for e):
  


To run task f):
 

Expected result for f):



To run task g):


Expected result for g):
